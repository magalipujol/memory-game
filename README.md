# "Memory game" project
I created this web page to learn how to manage cards and gain confidence with JavaScript HTML DOM.  
The first theme that came to my mind was kittens, but I decided to do another memory game using photos of my family.

## Languages and technologies I used
- I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek) YouTube tutorial  
- The design was made using CSS and Bootstrap 
- The cards are SVG images I created with Canva
